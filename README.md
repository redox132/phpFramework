# ABout
An MVC framework. This is a simple note APP using php, and MySQL. This idea is quite simple but the structure of the project is what matter the most. I created this note APP just to build and PHP framework (MVC) on  top of it. This project structure is quite similar to laravel's structure. This stucture is 100% OOP, routed using a Router, every request has it's contoller and a corresponding view, it made it also supports all methods (get and post are supported by default, but i aslo make it support delete, patch, and put), and it also supports Middlwares for autintication,. Besides, it is fully dockerized and can run every where.

# .env
do not forget to add the .env file for the app to run. I could upload it and this will be okay, but it is best to avoid that
